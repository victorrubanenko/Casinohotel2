        <div class="text">There is no shortage of outstanding casinos in Australia. But for travelers and those who want
            to get away for a few days and enjoy a loaded gambling spree, an in-and-out casino may not always be enough.
            Thankfully, casino hotels offer the opportunity to hop out of a comfortable bed, have a delicious breakfast
            on-site, and take but a few steps to slot machines and table games. Take a break when you need, dip your
            toes in the lush pool, and get back to winning money without ever leaving the facility - what a joy. But
            while there are hundreds of options for such luxury in Australia, not all offer the same grand experience
            you pictured in your head while reading this.
            Because a hotel offers gambling entertainment, you’re not always guaranteed the utmost convenience or
            quality casino games. Since you pay money for your casino hotel experience, get the best bang for your buck
            by ensuring that the qualities of both aspects are balanced. The best way to do that is by comparing
            available options, but since there is an unending list of casino hotels in Australia, we’ve narrowed down
            the choices leaving you with our favorite picks. The following options will make the hotel stay
            unforgettable and offer a gambling experience you won’t forget.</div>
